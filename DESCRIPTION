Description: This R package implements the two-stage pseudo maximum likelihood estimation (PMLE) for the copula-based analysis of the semi-competing risks data. The marginal distributions are modeled by semiparametric transformation regression models, and the dependence between the bivariate event times is specified by a parametric copula function with the copula parameter that may depend on some covariates.
